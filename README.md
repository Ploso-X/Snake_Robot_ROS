## Snake Robot Based On ROS and V-REP

This Project consist of Design and Development of moduler Snake Robot that uses ROS for robot programming and V-REP for robot simulation.

I have developed verious Kinematic Model for robot locomotion:
1. Serpentine 
2. Side winding -Left. 
3. Side winding -Right.
4. Side winding -Clockwise Rotation.
5. Side winding -Counterclockwise Rotation.
